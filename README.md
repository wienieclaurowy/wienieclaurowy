👾 Game Developer based in the Netherlands, focused on creating immersive experiences.

🧩 Currently Building: a new Godot project (working title Gothic Realms). Expect dark puzzles, eerie atmospheres and smooth controls.

🏰 Past Project: TBH (To Be Haunted) — a narrative‑driven adventure built in Godot where players explore a cursed manor filled with cryptic riddles and hidden lore.

🔭 Learning: advanced Godot features, procedural level generation, and improved shader effects.

💬 Ask me about: game architecture, GDScript, and blending narrative with gameplay.
